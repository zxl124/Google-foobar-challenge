# Google-foobar-challenge
I was invited to participate in the Google foobar challenge in 2018. Google foobar challenge is a set of coding challenges designed to recruit programmers for Google. Though I am not a software developer, I participated anyway and I find the challenge incredibly fun. My solutions are definitely not perfect, but they got me past level 3.
  
Challenge readme files belong to Google, obviously.
